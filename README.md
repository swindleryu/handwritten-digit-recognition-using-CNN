Group project: implement a handwritten digit recognition classifier using CNN in tensorflow

Requirement:
+ 1. Try to understand the following link https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers, https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py, and implement CNN classifier for MNIST data by adding extra layers or tuning the model using either tensorflow or keras. (Accuracy is not important, but implementation is must)
+ 2. Download the dataset from following link (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). It has both training and test data. If it is computationally expensive, try to use 50% of the data to fit the model.
+ 3. Implement the model in Python3
+ 4. Please cite, if you use any existing code or resources.

Extra credits:
+ 1.Improve the model further (test accuracy >=99.5%)
+ 2.Fix the bug for the Keras MNIST sample code  https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py
